# Process Watcher

## Goals

- Play with new react hooks API
- A tool that I would use everytime necessary
- Hacktoberfest

## Concept

Just a todo list with some twist:

1. Edit the todo list
2. Lock the todo list
3. Play the todo list from begin to end (like a process)
4. Bonus: notify someplace (slack channel?) the process progress
5. Add notes on each step if wanted (reflects what went wrong or missed or enhanced on the spot)
6. Generate a report in markdown
7. Bonus: export/import a todo template
